/** @file motionManager.cpp
 *  @brief Functions for managing motions.
 *
 *  These are the functions that: setup the pointers used to
 *  communicate with the memory shared between the application processor and PRU,
 *  place requests in the shared memory to the PRU motion worker, and to load a
 *  motion file from the file system into the shared memory so the PRU motion worker
 *  can retrieve and use them.
 *
 *  @author Bill Merryman
 *  @bug No known bugs.
